it seems that some orientation of the pictures taken from camera within cyanos are rotated wrong

as this is just a tag in the exif will check if the property

ro.media.capture.flip=horizontalandvertical
ro.media.sensor.orient=90

ro.com.motorola.smartsensor=true


will make some sense

hope that the smartsenor one will have effect against the compas rotated to 90 degree too
